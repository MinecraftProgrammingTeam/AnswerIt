# Intro

Inspiration comes from video [《你 问 我 打 ！》](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13V4y1W7X6/)

It is an upgraded version of the plugin in the video, and the selection issue is not just yes or no, multiple options can be customized

I also added a question and answer for filling in the blank, allowing players from all servers to jointly determine whether it is correct or not

# Usage

Download the latest version in [Release](https://github.com/MinecraftProgrammingTeam/AnswerIt/releases/latest) and put the jar file in a Minecraft server with BukkitAPI in plugins folder, and restart the server to apply it.

Test Environment("Server + Client"): `Paper1.16.5 + Minecraft 1.16.5`

Suggested server version>=1.16.5

Set project structure (sometimes automatically)

The loading Maven project will pop up in the lower right corner (sometimes automatically)

Click the upper right corner `Edit Configuration` and new a `Maven` project

Then write the commands `clean package`, and apply it.

The reward and punishment system's location: `top.mpt.huihui.answerit.prize.prize`

There are not many code comments, but there is still no problem understanding them.

ItemUtils are imported but not used, originally intended as a reward and punishment system, but i'm too lazy~

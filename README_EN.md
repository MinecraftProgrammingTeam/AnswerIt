# Intro

Inspiration comes from video [《你 问 我 打 ！》](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13V4y1W7X6/)

It is an upgraded version of the plugin in the video, and the selection issue is not just yes or no, multiple options can be customized

I also added a question and answer for filling in the blank, allowing players from all servers to jointly determine whether it is correct or not

# Usage

Download the latest version in [Release](https://github.com/MinecraftProgrammingTeam/AnswerIt/releases/latest) and put the jar file in a Minecraft server with BukkitAPI in plugins folder, and restart the server to apply it.

Suggested server version ≥ 1.13

Test Environment("Server + Client"):  `Spigot1.16.5 + Minecraft 1.16.5(MultiOfflineFix + fabric)`

PS: If you have found a bug that happened isn't the same as my Test Environment, you could try to find it in my Test Environment

If it's happened again, please upload it in Issues

Or you can upload it directly if you are too lazy to build a Test Environment(Please note the environment you used)

Issues Format:
- Questions & Bugs
- How to find it
- Your Environment(Ignore if it's the same as mine)
- Environment Format: Server Version + Client Version(Mods + ModLoader)
- eg. `Spigot1.16.5 + Minecraft 1.16.5(MultiOfflineFix + fabric)`

The reward and punishment system's location: `top.mpt.huihui.answerit.prize.prize`

There are not many code comments, but there is still no problem understanding them.

ItemUtils are imported but not used, originally intended as a reward and punishment system, but i'm too lazy~
